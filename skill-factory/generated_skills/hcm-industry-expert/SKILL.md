## How to Use This Skill

### Step 1: Gather Context and Requirements

Collect and analyze input data based on the specific use case:

- **For GTM/Sales Analysis**: Gather GTM structure documentation, sales performance data (bookings, pipeline, quota attainment, win/loss rates), CRM exports (Salesforce, HubSpot), marketing metrics, and compensation plans
- **For Competitive Analysis**: Collect competitive intelligence, win/loss data, vendor documentation, analyst reports, and market research
- **For Process Improvement**: Accept user's current process description (written or structured format), identify the process type (sales, implementation, support, etc.), and gather relevant metrics
- **For Strategic Planning**: Gather company financial data, product roadmaps, market research, strategic objectives, and business requirements
- **For Valuation/M&A**: Collect financial statements, customer metrics, market data, and comparable company information

Organize data with clear structure, source citations, and context. Identify the primary objective and secondary goals for the analysis.

### Step 2: Analyze HCM Industry Landscape or Current Process

**For Industry/Market Analysis:**
- Review references/hcm-industry-landscape.md for comprehensive vendor landscape and market structure
- Analyze market segmentation by category (Talent Acquisition, Core HR, Talent Management, Workforce Management, Employee Experience, Analytics)
- Assess competitive positioning across suite players, point solutions, and platform plays
- Evaluate market sizing, growth rates, and penetration by segment and geography
- Review technology architecture evolution trends and ecosystem dynamics

**For Process Improvement Analysis:**
- Load references/hcm-industry-landscape.md and references/management-consulting-frameworks.md for best practices
- Analyze the current process description against HCM industry best practices
- Identify the process category (recruiting, onboarding, implementation, support, sales, etc.)
- Map current process steps, stakeholders, and metrics
- Compare current metrics against industry benchmarks from references

### Step 3: Select and Apply Relevant Frameworks Contextually

Apply frameworks based on the specific use case:

- **For Valuation/M&A Requests**: Apply investment banking frameworks (DCF, comparables, precedent transactions) from references/investment-banking-frameworks.md
- **For Process Improvement**: Apply management consulting frameworks (process mapping, Six Sigma, Lean) from references/management-consulting-frameworks.md
- **For Market/Competitive Analysis**: Apply strategic frameworks (Porter's Five Forces, SWOT, TAM/SAM/SOM) from references/investment-banking-frameworks.md
- **For Strategic Planning**: Apply management consulting frameworks (McKinsey 3 Horizons, BCG Matrix) from references/management-consulting-frameworks.md
- **For Technology Decisions**: Apply build/buy/partner frameworks from references/enterprise-software-dynamics.md

**CRITICAL**: Only use DCF/valuation frameworks when valuation is explicitly requested. Do not include valuation frameworks for process improvement, general analysis, or strategic planning unless specifically requested.

### Step 4: Apply Investment Banking Frameworks (When Relevant)

For M&A, valuation, market sizing, or financial analysis requests:

- Load references/investment-banking-frameworks.md for analytical frameworks
- Apply market sizing methodology (TAM/SAM/SOM) for opportunity assessment
- Use competitive positioning analysis (Porter's Five Forces, market share analysis)
- Perform financial modeling (DCF only when valuation requested, revenue multiples, precedent transactions)
- Analyze unit economics (CAC, LTV, payback periods, Rule of 40)
- Evaluate comparable companies and precedent transactions for M&A analysis

### Step 5: Apply Management Consulting Frameworks (When Relevant)

For process improvement, organizational design, or operational excellence requests:

- Load references/management-consulting-frameworks.md for strategic frameworks

- Analyze impact of AI/ML integration, skills-based hiring, and employee experience focus
- Assess future of work implications (hybrid work, gig economy, skills-based org design)
- Evaluate convergence trends (HCM + finance, HCM + collaboration tools)
- Identify startup and innovation trends (new entrants, disruptive business models)
- Provide timeline projections (6-12-18-24 months) for strategic recommendations
- Flag areas of uncertainty and provide sensitivity analysis

### Step 7: Provide Strategic Recommendations

Develop actionable, specific recommendations:

- **For GTM/Sales**: Provide specific optimization strategies based on proven playbooks from successful HCM vendors (Workday, Greenhouse, Rippling), include benchmark comparisons, and quantify expected improvements
- **For Competitive Analysis**: Identify white space opportunities, competitive vulnerabilities, and strategic positioning recommendations
- **For Process Improvement**: Compare current process to best practices, identify gaps, provide specific recommendations with quantified improvements (time reduction, cost savings, efficiency gains), and include implementation roadmap
- **For Strategic Planning**: Provide market entry strategies, growth initiatives, product prioritization, and partnership recommendations with clear trade-offs
- **For Valuation/M&A**: Provide valuation analysis, strategic assessment, and investment thesis with clear assumptions and risk factors

Ensure all recommendations are specific, actionable, timeline-bound, and include quantified financial impact where feasible.

### Step 8: Generate Comprehensive Word Document Report

Use scripts/word_report_generator.py to create a professional Word document with extensive analysis findings:

**Formatting Requirements:**
- **Font**: Arial throughout the document
- **Margins**: Wide margins (1.5 inches on all sides for professional appearance)
- **Structure**: 
  - Title page with report title, author, date
  - Table of Contents (automatically generated)
  - Executive Summary
  - Main sections with clear headers (H1, H2, H3 hierarchy)
  - Bullet points for key findings and recommendations
  - Bold formatting for high-value strategic insights and key metrics
  - Tables for data presentation when appropriate
  - Professional section breaks

**Content Organization:**
- Organize content into logical sections with clear hierarchy
- Use bold formatting to highlight:
  - Key strategic insights and recommendations
  - Important metrics and benchmarks
  - Critical findings and implications
  - Action items and next steps
- Include bullet points for:
  - Key findings
  - Recommendations
  - Best practices
  - Risk factors
  - Opportunities

Use scripts/word_report_generator.py to generate the Word document:

```python
from word_report_generator import WordReportGenerator

generator = WordReportGenerator()
output_path = generator.create_hcm_analysis_report(
    title="HCM Industry Analysis Report",
    author_name="HCM Industry Expert",
    author_title="Investment Banker & Management Consultant",
    sections=[
        {
            'heading': 'Executive Summary',
            'content': 'Executive summary text with analysis findings...',
            'key_insights': ['Strategic insight one', 'Strategic insight two']  # Will be bolded
        },
        {
            'heading': 'Market Analysis Section',
            'content': 'Detailed market analysis content...',
            'subsections': [{'heading': 'Subsection', 'content': 'Content'}],
            'recommendations': ['Recommendation one', 'Recommendation two']  # Will be bolded
        }
    ],
    output_path='HCM_Industry_Analysis_Report.docx'
)
```

**Output file naming**: Save the Word document as `HCM_Industry_Analysis_Report.docx` (this is the default filename in the script).

### Step 9: Generate Markdown Report

Create a corresponding Markdown (.md) file with the same content and structure:

- Use Markdown formatting:
  - `#` for main headings (H1)
  - `##` for section headings (H2)
  - `###` for subsections (H3)
  - `**bold**` for high-value strategic insights and key metrics
  - `-` for bullet points
  - Tables using Markdown table syntax
- Maintain the same structure and content as the Word document
- Ensure formatting is clear and professional

**Output file naming**: Save the Markdown file as `HCM_Industry_Analysis_Report.md`.

### Step 10: Validate Outputs

Before finalizing, validate all outputs:

- **For Word Document**: Verify formatting matches requirements (Arial font, wide margins 1.5 inches, table of contents, clear headers, bold formatting for high-value insights)
- **For Markdown Document**: Verify Markdown formatting is correct (proper heading hierarchy, bold formatting for key insights, bullet points, tables)
- **For Financial Models**: Verify all calculations are correct, formulas are accurate, and data sources are cited
- **For Recommendations**: Verify recommendations are specific, actionable, and include quantified impacts with bold formatting for emphasis
- **For Process Improvement**: Verify gap analysis is accurate, recommendations are feasible, implementation roadmap is realistic, and key improvements are bolded
- **For Frameworks**: Verify only relevant frameworks are applied (no DCF for process improvement, appropriate frameworks for each use case)
- **For Strategic Insights**: Verify high-value strategic insights and key metrics are bolded or easily distinguishable in both Word and Markdown formats
