## Valuation Methodologies

### Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)

**When to Use**: Only when valuation is explicitly requested

**Key Components**:
- Revenue projections (3-5 years)
- EBITDA margins and cash flow
- Terminal value calculation (perpetuity growth or exit multiple)
- Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC)
- Discount factors

**For SaaS Companies**:
- Focus on ARR growth, retention rates, expansion revenue
- Unit economics (CAC, LTV, payback period)
- Rule of 40 (growth rate + EBITDA margin)

### Comparable Company Analysis (Comps)

**When to Use**: Market analysis, competitive positioning, valuation context

**Key Metrics**:
- Revenue multiples (EV/Revenue, Price/Sales)
- EBITDA multiples (EV/EBITDA)
- ARR multiples for SaaS companies
- Growth rates, margins, retention metrics

**HCM Industry Comps**:
- Workday: ~8-10x revenue
- Oracle: ~6-8x revenue
- Mid-market vendors: ~4-8x revenue
- Early-stage: ~2-5x revenue

### Precedent Transactions

**When to Use**: M&A analysis, valuation benchmarking

**Key Metrics**:
- Transaction multiples (EV/Revenue, EV/EBITDA)
- Premiums paid
- Strategic vs. financial buyer multiples

**Recent HCM M&A**:
- Workday acquisitions: Peakon, VNDLY
- Microsoft acquisition: Glint
- Private equity: Various roll-up strategies

## Market Sizing Frameworks

### TAM/SAM/SOM

**TAM (Total Addressable Market)**: Total market opportunity globally
**SAM (Serviceable Addressable Market)**: Market segment you can serve
**SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market)**: Realistic market share you can capture

**For HCM**:
- TAM: $25-30B global HCM software market
- SAM: Segment-specific (e.g., mid-market talent acquisition: $2-3B)
- SOM: Realistic market share (e.g., 5-10% of SAM = $100-300M)

### Market Growth Analysis

- Historical growth rates by segment
- Forward-looking projections (3-5 years)
- Penetration rates by geography and vertical
- Macro trends affecting growth

## Competitive Analysis Frameworks

### Porter's Five Forces

**When to Use**: Market structure analysis, competitive positioning

**Five Forces**:
1. **Threat of New Entrants**: Barriers to entry (capital, technology, partnerships)
2. **Bargaining Power of Suppliers**: Vendor dependencies, switching costs
3. **Bargaining Power of Buyers**: Customer concentration, switching costs
4. **Threat of Substitutes**: Alternative solutions, workarounds
5. **Competitive Rivalry**: Market concentration, differentiation

### Strategic Group Mapping

**When to Use**: Competitive landscape visualization

**Dimensions**:
- X-axis: Market segment (enterprise vs. mid-market vs. SMB)
- Y-axis: Product breadth (suite vs. point solution)
- Plot competitors by position

### Gartner Magic Quadrant Positioning

**When to Use**: Competitive positioning analysis

**Quadrants**:
- Leaders: High ability to execute, completeness of vision
- Challengers: High ability to execute, lower vision
- Visionaries: High vision, lower execution
- Niche Players: Focused capabilities

## Financial Modeling Approaches

### SaaS Metrics Analysis

**Key Metrics**:
- **ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue)**: Core SaaS metric
- **ACV (Annual Contract Value)**: Average contract size
- **CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost)**: Cost to acquire customer
- **LTV (Lifetime Value)**: Total revenue from customer
- **CAC Payback**: Months to recover CAC
- **Rule of 40**: Growth rate % + EBITDA margin % (target: 40+)
- **Magic Number**: Net new ARR / Sales & Marketing spend (target: 0.75+)
- **GRR (Gross Revenue Retention)**: Retention of existing revenue
- **NRR (Net Revenue Retention)**: Retention + expansion revenue

### Unit Economics

**By Customer Segment**:
- Enterprise: High CAC, high LTV, long payback
- Mid-Market: Medium CAC, medium LTV, medium payback
- SMB: Low CAC, lower LTV, short payback

**Benchmarks**:
- CAC Payback: 12-18 months target
- LTV/CAC Ratio: 3:1 minimum, 5:1+ ideal
- Rule of 40: 40%+ for healthy SaaS companies
