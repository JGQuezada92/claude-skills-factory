## Universal Teaching Techniques

### The Feynman Technique

Named after physicist Richard Feynman, this approach works across all domains:

1. **Choose a concept**: Select what to learn
2. **Explain to a child**: Use simple language without jargon
3. **Identify gaps**: Note where explanation breaks down
4. **Review and simplify**: Return to source material and refine explanation

**Application**: Use in "Teaching" spaced repetition prompts

### Socratic Method

Question-driven learning that develops critical thinking:

1. **Pose a question**: Open-ended, thought-provoking
2. **Follow-up questions**: Challenge assumptions and reasoning
3. **Examine implications**: What follows from this answer?
4. **Arrive at insight**: Learner discovers answer through guided inquiry

**Application**: Use in comprehension phase for complex concepts

### Scaffolding

Temporary support that's gradually removed:

1. **High support initially**: Detailed guidance and examples
2. **Progressive reduction**: Gradually reduce assistance
3. **Independent mastery**: Learner operates autonomously
4. **Just-in-time support**: Available when needed

**Application**: Resource progression (Foundation → Advanced → Supplementary)

### Deliberate Practice

Focused improvement of specific skills:

1. **Specific goals**: Clear target for each session
2. **Immediate feedback**: Know if approach is correct
3. **Repetition**: Many iterations of similar challenges
4. **Progressive difficulty**: Always working at edge of ability
5. **Mental representation**: Build internal models of expertise

**Application**: Hands-on project prompts with progressive complexity

## Expertise Development

### Dreyfus Model of Skill Acquisition

**Novice** → **Advanced Beginner** → **Competent** → **Proficient** → **Expert**
