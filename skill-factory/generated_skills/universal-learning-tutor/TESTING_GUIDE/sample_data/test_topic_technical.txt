Sample Topic Request - Technical Subject

Topic: Introduction to Reinforcement Learning

User Profile:
- Background: Software engineer with ML basics (taken Andrew Ng's course)
- Current Knowledge Level: Intermediate (understand supervised learning well)
- Learning Goal: Implement RL algorithms for game AI
- Time Available: 8 hours per week
- Preferred Format: Both visual and audio (want to listen during commute, reference while coding)

Specific Interests:
- Q-Learning and Deep Q-Networks
- Policy Gradient methods
- Actor-Critic algorithms
- Practical implementation (not just theory)

Expected Challenge Areas:
- Understanding Markov Decision Processes
- Balancing exploration vs. exploitation
- Credit assignment problem
- Debugging RL algorithms

Success Criteria:
- Build a working game AI using RL
- Understand when to use which algorithm
- Debug common RL training issues

Additional Context:
- Have experience with TensorFlow/PyTorch
- Want real code examples, not just pseudocode
- Interested in both theory and practice
