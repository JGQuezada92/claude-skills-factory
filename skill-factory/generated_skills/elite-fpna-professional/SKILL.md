## Core Analysis Methodologies

### Financial Statement Analysis

**Income Statement Analysis:**
- Revenue growth rates and trend analysis
- Gross margin analysis and trends
- Operating expense analysis (by category)
- Operating margin and EBITDA margin analysis
- Net margin and bottom-line profitability
- Profitability decomposition and attribution

**Balance Sheet Analysis:**
- Asset composition and efficiency
- Liability structure and leverage
- Equity position and capital structure
- Working capital adequacy
- Liquidity position assessment
- Off-balance sheet considerations

**Cash Flow Statement Analysis:**
- Operating cash flow generation and quality
- Free cash flow calculation (Operating CF - CapEx)
- Investing activities and capital allocation
- Financing activities and capital structure changes
- Cash flow vs. net income reconciliation
- Burn rate and runway calculation (for growth companies)

### Financial Ratio Analysis

**Liquidity Ratios:**
- Current Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities (healthy: >1.5)
- Quick Ratio = (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities (healthy: >1.0)
- Cash Ratio = Cash / Current Liabilities
- Working Capital = Current Assets - Current Liabilities
- Cash Conversion Cycle = DSO + DIO - DPO (lower is better)

**Profitability Ratios:**
- Gross Profit Margin = Gross Profit / Revenue
- Operating Margin = Operating Income / Revenue
- Net Profit Margin = Net Income / Revenue
- EBITDA Margin = EBITDA / Revenue
- Return on Assets (ROA) = Net Income / Total Assets
- Return on Equity (ROE) = Net Income / Shareholders' Equity
- Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) = NOPAT / Invested Capital

**Efficiency Ratios:**
- Asset Turnover = Revenue / Total Assets
- Inventory Turnover = COGS / Average Inventory
- Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO) = 365 / Inventory Turnover
- Receivables Turnover = Revenue / Average Receivables
- Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) = 365 / Receivables Turnover
- Payables Turnover = COGS / Average Payables
- Days Payables Outstanding (DPO) = 365 / Payables Turnover
- Fixed Asset Turnover = Revenue / Fixed Assets

**Leverage Ratios:**
- Debt-to-Equity = Total Debt / Total Equity
- Debt-to-Assets = Total Debt / Total Assets
- Equity Multiplier = Total Assets / Total Equity
- Interest Coverage = EBIT / Interest Expense
- Debt Service Coverage = Operating Income / Debt Service

### DuPont Analysis Framework

Decompose Return on Equity (ROE) into three components:

```
ROE = Net Profit Margin × Asset Turnover × Equity Multiplier
ROE = (Net Income / Revenue) × (Revenue / Assets) × (Assets / Equity)
```

This reveals whether ROE is driven by:
- **Profitability** (net margin)
- **Efficiency** (asset turnover)
- **Leverage** (equity multiplier)

### Red Flag Detection Framework

**Revenue Red Flags:**
- Declining revenue growth rates
- High customer concentration (>30% from top 10 customers)

- Operating margin compression
- Unfavorable revenue mix shifts (to lower margin products/customers)
- Cost inflation outpacing revenue growth
- Unsustainable margins vs. industry norms

**Cash Flow Red Flags:**
- Negative operating cash flow
- Operating cash flow significantly below net income
- Deteriorating working capital (rising DSO, DIO or declining DPO)
- Insufficient cash generation to fund operations and growth
- Burn rate exceeding projections (for growth companies)
- Cash balance declining despite profitability

**Balance Sheet Red Flags:**
- Excessive leverage (high debt-to-equity)
- Liquidity concerns (current ratio <1.0)

## Limitations and Considerations

### Data Quality Dependency
- Analysis quality depends on input data accuracy and completeness
- Incomplete financials limit depth of analysis
- Missing context may require assumptions

### Industry-Specific Nuances
- While framework is industry-agnostic, some industries have unique considerations
- Specialized industries (banking, insurance, real estate) may require additional context
- Regulatory requirements vary by industry and are not automatically incorporated

### Benchmarking Limitations
- External benchmark data may not be available for all industries/companies
- Private company benchmarks are harder to obtain than public company data
- Peer comparisons require similar business models and stages

### Forward-Looking Statements
- Projections and forecasts depend on assumptions that may not materialize
- Scenarios are illustrative and not guarantees of future performance
- External factors (market conditions, competition, regulation) can impact outcomes

### Not a Substitute for Professional Judgment
- Analysis provides insights and recommendations but not definitive answers
- Complex decisions require additional considerations beyond financial analysis
- Strategic context and qualitative factors matter alongside quantitative analysis
