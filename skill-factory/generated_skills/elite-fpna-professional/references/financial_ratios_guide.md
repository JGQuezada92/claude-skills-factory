## Liquidity Ratios

Liquidity ratios measure a company's ability to meet short-term obligations and convert assets to cash.

### Current Ratio

**Formula:** Current Assets ÷ Current Liabilities

**Interpretation:**
- **> 2.0:** Strong liquidity position, comfortable margin of safety
- **1.5 - 2.0:** Healthy liquidity, adequate to meet obligations
- **1.0 - 1.5:** Acceptable but limited cushion
- **< 1.0:** Liquidity concern, may struggle with short-term obligations

**What It Tells You:** For every dollar of current liabilities, how many dollars of current assets are available

**Industry Considerations:** Manufacturing and retail typically need higher ratios due to inventory; service companies can operate with lower ratios

---

### Quick Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio)

**Formula:** (Current Assets - Inventory) ÷ Current Liabilities

**Interpretation:**
- **> 1.5:** Excellent liquidity without relying on inventory sales
- **1.0 - 1.5:** Good liquidity position
- **0.7 - 1.0:** Adequate for most businesses
- **< 0.7:** Potential liquidity issues

**What It Tells You:** Ability to meet short-term obligations without selling inventory (more conservative than current ratio)

**Why It Matters:** Inventory may not be quickly convertible to cash, so this ratio provides a more stringent liquidity test

---

### Cash Ratio

**Formula:** Cash & Cash Equivalents ÷ Current Liabilities

**Interpretation:**
- **> 0.5:** Strong cash position
- **0.2 - 0.5:** Adequate cash reserves
- **< 0.2:** Limited cash liquidity

**What It Tells You:** The most conservative liquidity measure - only considers cash and near-cash assets

**Use Case:** Important for assessing worst-case liquidity scenario

---

### Working Capital

**Formula:** Current Assets - Current Liabilities

**Interpretation:**
- **Positive:** Company has more current assets than liabilities
- **Negative:** Liquidity concern, may need additional funding
- **Trend:** Increasing working capital can indicate growing business or declining efficiency

**What It Tells You:** Absolute amount of liquidity cushion (not a ratio)

**Management Focus:** Optimize working capital to balance liquidity needs with efficiency

---

### Cash Conversion Cycle

**Formula:** DSO + DIO - DPO

Where:
- DSO = Days Sales Outstanding
- DIO = Days Inventory Outstanding
- DPO = Days Payables Outstanding

**Interpretation:**
- **Negative:** Cash-generating business model (collect before you pay)
- **0-30 days:** Excellent working capital efficiency
- **30-60 days:** Good efficiency
- **60-90 days:** Acceptable but room for improvement
- **> 90 days:** Inefficient working capital management

**What It Tells You:** Number of days to convert investments in inventory and receivables into cash

**Improvement Levers:** Reduce DSO (collect faster), reduce DIO (manage inventory better), extend DPO (negotiate better terms)

---

## Profitability Ratios

---

### Return on Equity (ROE)

**Formula:** Net Income ÷ Shareholders' Equity × 100

**Interpretation:**
- **> 20%:** Excellent return to shareholders
- **15-20%:** Strong return
- **10-15%:** Moderate return
- **< 10%:** Low return

**What It Tells You:** Return generated for shareholders' investment

---

### Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)

**Formula:** NOPAT ÷ Invested Capital × 100

Where:
- NOPAT = Net Operating Profit After Tax = Operating Income × (1 - Tax Rate)
- Invested Capital = Total Debt + Total Equity - Cash

**Interpretation:**

## DuPont Analysis

A framework for decomposing ROE into three components:

**Formula:** ROE = Net Profit Margin × Asset Turnover × Equity Multiplier

**Components:**
1. **Net Profit Margin:** Profitability (Net Income ÷ Revenue)
2. **Asset Turnover:** Efficiency (Revenue ÷ Assets)
3. **Equity Multiplier:** Leverage (Assets ÷ Equity)

**Use Case:** Identifies what's driving ROE:
- High profitability?
- Efficient asset use?
- Financial leverage?

**Example:**
- Company A: 15% margin × 1.0 turnover × 2.0 leverage = 30% ROE (profitability-driven)
- Company B: 5% margin × 3.0 turnover × 2.0 leverage = 30% ROE (efficiency-driven)

Both have same ROE but very different business models!

## Ratio Analysis Best Practices

### 1. Use Multiple Ratios
No single ratio tells the complete story. Analyze ratios in groups (liquidity, profitability, efficiency, leverage).

### 2. Analyze Trends
Compare ratios over multiple periods to identify improving or deteriorating trends.

### 3. Benchmark Appropriately
- Compare to industry peers
- Consider company size and stage
- Adjust for business model differences

### 4. Understand Limitations
- Ratios use historical data
- Accounting policies affect comparability
- Industry and business model variations

### 5. Context Matters
- Growth stage companies may have temporarily poor ratios
- Turnaround situations require different interpretation
- Seasonal businesses need period-appropriate comparisons

---

## Industry-Specific Considerations

### Technology / SaaS
- Focus on: Gross margin (should be >70%), R&D as % of revenue, CAC payback, Rule of 40
- Lower importance on: Asset turnover, inventory ratios (no inventory)

### Retail
- Focus on: Inventory turnover, same-store sales, gross margin, working capital efficiency
- Seasonal adjustments critical

### Manufacturing
- Focus on: Asset turnover, capacity utilization, inventory management, ROIC
- Capital intensity affects many ratios

### Financial Services
- Different ratios apply: Net interest margin, efficiency ratio, ROA, loan-to-deposit ratio
- Standard manufacturing/retail ratios less applicable

### Professional Services
- Focus on: Utilization rate, realization rate, revenue per professional
- Minimal working capital needs
