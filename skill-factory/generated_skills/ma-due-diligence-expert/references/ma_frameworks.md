# M&A Due Diligence Frameworks

## Elite Investment Bank Methodologies

### Goldman Sachs Hypothesis-Driven Approach

Goldman Sachs employs a hypothesis-driven methodology that focuses on testing key investment theses and identifying critical risks early in the process.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Develop clear hypotheses about value creation and key risks upfront
- Use red flag matrices to prioritize issues by severity (high/medium/low)
- Focus resources on high-impact areas rather than exhaustive review
- Rapid identification of deal-breakers to enable early exit if needed
- Quantified synergy analysis with detailed implementation plans

**Red Flag Matrix Framework:**
| Severity | Financial Impact | Likelihood | Examples |
|----------|-----------------|------------|----------|
| High | >10% of deal value | Probable | Customer concentration >40%, Key person dependency, Major litigation |
| Medium | 5-10% of deal value | Possible | Tech debt, Working capital needs, Vendor concentration |
| Low | <5% of deal value | Unlikely | Minor compliance issues, Small contract gaps |

**Application in Technology M&A:**
- Focus on revenue quality and customer retention as primary hypotheses
- Test technology scalability and technical debt assumptions early
- Validate management team capabilities through reference checks
- Quantify integration complexity and synergy realization risk

### JP Morgan Deal Scorecard Methodology

JP Morgan uses a structured scorecard approach with weighted criteria across functional workstreams to provide objective, comparable assessments.

**Scorecard Categories (100 point scale):**
1. **Strategic Fit (20 points):** Market position, competitive moats, strategic rationale
2. **Financial Quality (25 points):** Revenue quality, margin sustainability, cash generation
3. **Commercial Strength (20 points):** Customer relationships, market share, go-to-market effectiveness
4. **Technology/Product (15 points):** Product-market fit, technical capabilities, IP strength
5. **Management Team (10 points):** Experience, track record, cultural fit
6. **Risk Profile (10 points):** Identified risks weighted by probability and impact

**Scoring Methodology:**
- 90-100: Exceptional opportunity with minimal risks
- 75-89: Strong opportunity with manageable risks
- 60-74: Acceptable opportunity requiring risk mitigation
- Below 60: Pass or request significant price adjustment

**Deal Scorecard Template:**
```
Category                  Weight    Score (1-10)  Weighted Score
Strategic Fit             20%       8             1.6
Financial Quality         25%       7             1.75
Commercial Strength       20%       9             1.8
Technology/Product        15%       7             1.05
Management Team           10%       8             0.8
Risk Profile              10%       6             0.6
----------------------------------------
Total Score                         -             7.6 / 10
```

### Morgan Stanley Functional Workstream Approach

Morgan Stanley employs a comprehensive functional workstream approach with specialist teams conducting deep-dives in parallel.

**Workstream Structure:**
- **Financial Workstream:** Quality of Earnings, working capital, tax
- **Commercial Workstream:** Customer analysis, market position, go-to-market
- **Technology Workstream:** Tech stack, IP, security, scalability
- **Operational Workstream:** Organization, processes, systems
- **Legal/Regulatory Workstream:** Contracts, litigation, compliance

**Coordination Framework:**
- Weekly cross-functional sync meetings to share findings
- Integrated issues list with cross-workstream dependencies flagged
