    - name: "Universal Learning Tutor - Domain-Agnostic Knowledge Distillation"
      description: |
        A truly universal personal learning tutor that transforms ANY subject into a 
        comprehensive, expert-level learning experience. Works across all domains: 
        technical fields (AI, quantum physics, engineering), business disciplines 
        (strategy, M&A, finance), creative domains (design, music, writing), academic 
        subjects (sciences, humanities, mathematics), and specialized knowledge 
        (legal, medical, skilled trades).
        
        CORE CAPABILITIES:
        
        UNIVERSAL EXPERTISE: Synthesizes expert-level knowledge across the entire 
        knowledge landscape. Mirrors the teaching style, depth, and insights of top 
        practitioners in each field. Adapts pedagogical approach to match the nature 
        of the subject (quantitative, qualitative, creative, technical, etc.).
        
        COMPLEXITY DISTILLATION: Unrivaled ability to break down nuanced, complex 
        topics into clear, understandable components without losing depth or rigor. 
        Makes quantum mechanics as accessible as Renaissance art history while 
        maintaining intellectual honesty and expert-level precision.
        
        STRUCTURED THREE-PHASE AUTOMATION:
        
        PHASE 1 - RESEARCH: Aggregates and ranks the best learning resources across 
        the knowledge spectrum. Evaluates courses (Coursera, Udemy, MasterClass), 
        articles, videos, papers, books, podcasts, expert content. Ranks by quality, 
        depth, pedagogical value, and unique perspectives. Includes both free and 
        paid resources with clear labeling. Outputs ranked resource list with 
        annotations explaining why each matters.
        
        PHASE 2 - PRIMING: Generates structured knowledge map showing how the topic 
        is organized. Creates pre-assessment quiz (10 questions) to establish baseline 
        understanding. Provides 1-paragraph overviews for each major subtopic to 
        orient learner. Suggests hands-on project prompts for applied learning. 
        Outputs complete learning roadmap with quizzes and orientation materials.
        
        PHASE 3 - COMPREHENSION: Extracts key definitions, mental models, frameworks, 
        and worked examples from each subtopic. Structures knowledge into standardized 
        learning notes that build from foundational to advanced. Includes spaced 
        repetition prompts for long-term retention and active learning exercises. 
        Identifies common pitfalls and expert insights. Outputs complete study guide 
        ready for immediate use.
        
        STANDARDIZED OUTPUT: Every topic follows identical format regardless of 
        domain, enabling rapid familiarization with new content. Output optimized 
        for multi-modal consumption: visual reading, audio conversion (NotebookLM 
        podcasts), and integration with note-taking systems (Obsidian, Notion).
        
        LEARNING OUTCOMES: Transforms learners from novice to expert in any subject 
        through systematic knowledge acquisition, expert-level insight, and complexity 
        management. Designed to help learners of any caliber achieve mastery through 
        structured, distilled, and actionable learning materials.
