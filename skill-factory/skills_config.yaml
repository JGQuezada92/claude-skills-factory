  description: |
    I am a market liquidity analyst specializing in global liquidity cycle analysis following 
    the methodology developed by Michael Howell of CrossBorder Capital. My workflow involves 
    analyzing central bank balance sheets, tracking monetary aggregates (M2, M3, base money), 
    monitoring cross-border capital flows, and assessing the impact of liquidity conditions 
    on asset prices. I produce comprehensive liquidity analysis reports that identify cycle 
    phases, forecast turning points, and provide forward-looking assessments of liquidity 
    conditions across major economies. My analysis framework focuses on the 60-65 month 
    liquidity cycles, debt-liquidity interdependence, collateral market health, and the 
    relationship between monetary policy actions and financial market performance.

        Conduct comprehensive market liquidity analysis following Michael Howell's CrossBorder 
        Capital methodology. This skill should perform analysis at the level of an experienced 
        liquidity cycle analyst, including:
        
        **Core Analysis Components:**
        - Global Liquidity Cycle Identification: Identify and track 60-65 month liquidity cycles 
          across major economies, determine current cycle phase (expansion, peak, contraction, trough), 
          and forecast cycle turning points
        - Central Bank Balance Sheet Analysis: Analyze Federal Reserve, ECB, BOJ, PBOC, and other 
          major central bank balance sheets, track QE/QT programs, policy rate changes, and forward 
          guidance implications
        - Cross-Border Capital Flow Tracking: Monitor cross-border capital flows, FX liquidity 
          conditions, reserve currency dynamics, and international liquidity transmission mechanisms
        - Monetary Aggregates Analysis: Track M0, M1, M2, M3 monetary aggregates across major 
          economies, analyze money supply growth rates, velocity of money, and credit creation
        - Debt-Liquidity Interdependence Analysis: Assess the symbiotic relationship between debt 
          and liquidity, analyze refinancing requirements, debt rollover risks, and liquidity needs 
          for debt servicing
        - Collateral Market Health Monitoring: Track bond market volatility, repo market spreads, 
          margin requirements, and collateral quality indicators to assess system liquidity capacity
        - Liquidity-Asset Price Correlation Analysis: Analyze relationship between liquidity 
          conditions and asset prices (equities, bonds, commodities), identify liquidity-driven 
          asset price movements, and assess forward-looking asset price implications
        - Forward-Looking Liquidity Forecasts: Provide forward-looking assessments of liquidity 
          conditions, cycle positioning, and potential turning points based on leading and lagging 
          indicators
        
        **Output Requirements:**
        - Excel Models: Generate comprehensive Excel workbooks with liquidity cycle tracking, central 
          bank balance sheet analysis, cross-border flow models, monetary aggregates tracking, and 
          asset price correlation analysis with charts and visualizations
        - Written Analysis Reports: Create professional liquidity analysis reports (2-5 pages) 
          with cycle positioning, current liquidity assessment, forward-looking forecasts, and 
          asset price implications in PDF format
        - Visualizations: Generate charts showing liquidity cycles, central bank balance sheets 
          over time, cross-border flows, monetary aggregates trends, and asset price correlations
        
        **Report Structure:**
        - Executive Summary: Current liquidity cycle phase, key findings, and forward-looking 
          implications
        - Global Liquidity Cycle Assessment: Current cycle positioning, phase identification, 
          historical context, and forecasted turning points
        - Central Bank Policy Analysis: Analysis of major central bank balance sheets, policy 
          actions, and their liquidity implications
        - Cross-Border Capital Flows: Analysis of international liquidity flows and FX conditions
        - Monetary Aggregates Review: Money supply analysis across major economies
        - Collateral Market Health: Assessment of bond markets, repo markets, and systemic 
          liquidity capacity
        - Asset Price Implications: Analysis of how current liquidity conditions affect equities, 
          bonds, and commodities
        - Forward-Looking Forecast: Liquidity cycle projections and potential market implications
        
        **Writing Style:**
        - Data-driven with specific metrics, charts, and quantitative analysis
        - Clear cycle phase identification and positioning
        - Forward-looking with specific forecasts and timeline projections
        - Balanced presentation of both leading and lagging indicators
        - Institutional quality suitable for portfolio managers and investment committees
        
        The skill should handle inputs like:
        - Central bank balance sheet data (time series from Fed, ECB, BOJ, PBOC, etc.)
        - Monetary aggregates data (M0, M1, M2, M3 from central banks and statistical agencies)
        - Cross-border capital flow data (from BIS, IMF, central banks)
        - Market data (bond yields, equity prices, FX rates, commodity prices)
        - Economic indicators (GDP, inflation, credit growth, money velocity)
        - Central bank policy statements and forward guidance
        
        Output should be formatted as comprehensive liquidity analysis with Excel models containing 
        formulas, charts, and dashboards, plus written reports with visualizations and forward-looking 
        forecasts.
